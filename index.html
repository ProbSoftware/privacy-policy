        <h1>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 12, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction and Scope</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the terms of use and data security practices for <strong>Movie Album</strong> ("the Application"), provided by ProbSoftware. The Application is an interface service that provides movie/TV show recommendations and displays streaming availability (Watch Providers).</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection and Privacy (No Server-Side)</h2>
        <p>Our application prioritizes user privacy above all else.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> The Application does not collect, record, or share any personal data from users, such as name, email, location, phone number, or device ID.</li>
            <li><strong>No Accounts or Servers:</strong> The Application does not have a membership system or an external server (backend) where data is stored. All operations (adding to favorites, filtering, etc.) take place locally on the user's own device (local storage). This data is lost when the Application is uninstalled.</li>
            <li><strong>Ads:</strong> No advertisements are displayed within the Application at this time, and no tracking codes (trackers) are used for advertising purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>User Support & Feedback:</strong> If you choose to contact us via email for support or feedback, we will only use the information you provide (such as your email address and device model) to respond to your request and resolve technical issues. We do not use this information for marketing purposes or share it with third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Content and API Usage (Disclaimer)</h2>
        <p>The Application uses public third-party API services to provide content.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Movie information, images (posters/backdrops), and metadata are provided by <strong>The Movie Database (TMDB)</strong>. Streaming platform information is based on <strong>JustWatch</strong> data via TMDB.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Content Warning:</strong> All images and texts displayed are pulled automatically via API. The developer has no manual or real-time control over this content (e.g., movie posters, summaries).</li>
            <li><strong>Age Rating and Sensitive Content:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adult Content (+18) is strictly DISABLED</strong> by default within the application infrastructure.</li>
                    <li>However, original posters or metadata for movies in genres such as "Romance", "Horror", "Thriller", or "Drama" may still contain mild sexuality, horror elements, or mature themes provided by the third-party API.</li>
                    <li>Due to these potential external data variations, the application is rated for users <strong>12 years and older (12+)</strong>. Parental guidance is recommended.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>User Agreement:</strong> The user acknowledges that the Application is not a "Content Creator" but merely an "Interface Provider" displaying third-party data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Copyrights and Trademarks</h2>
        <p>All movie titles, images, and company logos (Netflix, Disney+, etc.) mentioned in the Application are the property of their respective owners.</p>
        <p><em>This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.</em></p>

        <h2>5. Changes</h2>
        <p>The developer reserves the right to update this privacy policy and terms of use. If there is a change in the application's data collection practices (e.g., adding advertisements in the future), this page will be updated accordingly.</p>
